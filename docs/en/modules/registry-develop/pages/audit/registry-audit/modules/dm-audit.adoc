== Audit cases

[#_dm_01]
=== DM-01. Indexes for search conditions
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Create indexes to optimize the performance of search queries. Avoid duplication and redundant indexes.

Impact ::
* Lack of indexes significantly degrades query performance.
* Duplicate or redundant indexes waste resources and complicate maintenance.

Recommendations ::
* Use the `indexing="true"` attribute in the `ext:createSearchCondition` tag to automatically create necessary indexes.
* Use the `createIndex` tag for manually creating indexes, for example, for `join` fields.
* Avoid creating indexes on columns with low selectivity or on small tables.
* Remove duplicates using the `dropIndex` tag.

[#_dm_02]
=== DM-02. Redundant changesets within one release
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
Remove redundant changesets created during the development phase before release.

Impact ::
* Complicates `changelog` management.
* Increases the time needed to apply database migrations.

Recommendations ::
* Consolidate changes into one logical changeset when possible.
* Use `clean-up` for resetting the development environment if necessary.

[#_dm_03]
=== DM-03. Naming convention for changeset identifiers
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Low

Description ::
Follow a unified naming convention for changeset identifiers.

Impact ::
* Makes changes easier to understand by all team members.
* Simplifies searching and navigation in migration files.

Recommendations ::
* Use descriptive identifiers.
* Maintain a consistent naming format throughout the project.

[#_dm_04]
=== DM-04. Columns included in search conditions
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Include only columns that are actually used in business processes, forms, or APIs.

Impact ::
* Inefficient data processing.
* Increased risk of leaking sensitive information.
* Additional load on the system.

Recommendations ::
* Create separate search conditions for different needs (avoid the _"God Object"_ anti-pattern).

[#_dm_05]
=== DM-05. Limits for search conditions
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Always specify limits when designing search conditions.

Impact ::
* Without limits, there is a risk of data leakage.
* Can lead to high database load.

Recommendations ::
* Use the `limit` attribute in the `ext:createSearchCondition` tag.

[#_dm_06]
=== DM-06. Database schema normalization
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Follow the Third Normal Form (3NF) when modeling the database schema.

Impact ::
* Improves data integrity.
* Reduces duplication and storage requirements.
* Simplifies maintenance and scalability.

Recommendations ::
* Use 3NF as the default modeling practice.
* Deviate from 3NF only with a clear understanding of the trade-offs.

[#_dm_07]
=== DM-07. Partial updates
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
Prefer partial updates (`partialUpdate`) over full entity updates.

Impact ::
* Reduces database calls.
* Simplifies business process logic.

Recommendations ::
* Create partial update APIs using the `ext:partialUpdate` tag.

[#_dm_08]
=== DM-08. Use of Liquibase SQL tags
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Use only standard Liquibase tags supported by the platform.

Impact ::
* Custom SQL may be incompatible with future platform updates.
* Increased risk of runtime errors.

Recommendations ::
* Prefer Liquibase tags over raw SQL wherever possible.
* Carefully test changes if using SQL manually.

[#_dm_09]
=== DM-09. Pagination in search conditions
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Apply pagination when creating search conditions.

Impact ::
* Reduces load on the server and network.
* Improves the user experience when working with large data volumes.

Recommendations ::
* Use the `pagination` attribute in the `ext:createSearchCondition` tag.
* Pagination types:
** `pagination="page"` — if the total number of pages and rows needs to be known.
** `pagination="offset"` — if total pages and row count are not critical (this is the default pagination type).
