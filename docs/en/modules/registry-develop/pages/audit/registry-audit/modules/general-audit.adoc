=== GN-01. Components in development
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
Some registry regulation components (business processes, forms, tables, etc.) may still be under development or created solely for demonstration purposes.
Such components must not be included in the registry regulation when releasing software into production.

Impact ::
* **System instability:** Unfinished components may contain bugs or incomplete functionality.
* **Security risks:** Unreviewed components may introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Incorrect functionality:** Demonstration components may not reflect real business processes, misleading users.

Recommendations ::
* **Verification and testing:** Before releasing to production, thoroughly verify all components. Ensure they are complete and have passed all necessary testing stages.
* **Removal of demonstration components:** Components created solely for demo purposes must be excluded from the production release.
* **Regular audit:** Perform regular audits to detect components still under development and remove them from the registry regulation.
