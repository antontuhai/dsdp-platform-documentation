== Audit cases

[#_fr_01]
=== FR-01. Large forms
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
Design forms as simple and compact as possible.

Impact ::
* Reduced rendering performance in the browser.
* Complicated maintenance and updates by registry developers.
* Poor user experience when filling out or viewing the form.
* Higher risk of system errors (for example, session timeouts resulting in data loss).
* Increased complexity of form testing due to a large number of test cases.

Recommendations ::
* When entering data, split large forms into smaller steps and collect data in phases.
* When displaying data:
** Show a limited set of data by default.
** Use reports or extracts to display detailed information.
* Avoid deeply nested components with complex dependencies.

NOTE: For more details on best practices for web form development, see https://nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/[this article].

[#_fr_02]
=== FR-02. Lazy load for the _Select_ component
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
When a form contains a large number of *Select* components, use lazy loading to fetch data via URL.
By default, *Select* components perform eager loading and fetch data in the following cases:

* When the form is initially rendered.
* When a related component changes.
* When a user token is refreshed—a system event triggered independently of user actions.

Impact ::
* Additional load on servers and networks.
* Longer form rendering time.

Recommendations ::
* Avoid creating large forms (see <<_fr_01>>).
* Use lazy loading for *Select* components if there are more than five components on a form.
* Use eager loading only if it significantly improves user experience, such as fetching data for the first *Select* immediately upon form rendering.

[#_fr_03]
=== FR-03. JavaScript logic in form components
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
The form builder provides built-in capabilities for data handling and validation.
Additionally, you can use JavaScript for specific settings like validation, conditional display, or custom default values.
While flexible, complex or excessive JavaScript logic increases hidden complexity, making debugging and maintenance harder.

Impact ::
Maintaining complex JavaScript logic at the form modeling level becomes inconvenient and error-prone, especially when teams change or when projects are transferred for support.

Recommendations ::
* Control JavaScript usage. Keep the logic simple and straightforward whenever possible.
* Use built-in form builder features for data handling and validation.
* Avoid side effects. Each JavaScript block must have a single responsibility (validation, conditional display, or data processing) and must not affect unrelated parts of the form.

[#_fr_04]
=== FR-04. External API services in the _Select_ component
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
The *Select* component can fetch data from external APIs located on different domains, often used for lookups.
Additionally, it can include authentication cookies in requests to external services if necessary.
You must properly configure both the API server and the form to ensure correct cross-domain requests and cookie handling.
+
NOTE: Authentication cookie acquisition from external domains is beyond the scope of this document.

Impact ::
* The browser may block API requests due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy violations.
* The API server may reject requests if required authentication cookies are missing.

Recommendations ::
* If the API service is public and does not require authentication:
** Disable authentication cookie transmission in the *Select* component settings (`Add authentication cookies for cross-site requests` = false).
** Ensure that the API service returns the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with either the user portal domain or wildcard `*`.
* If the API service requires authentication using cookies:
** Enable authentication cookie transmission in the *Select* component settings (`Add authentication cookies for cross-site requests` = true).
** Ensure that the API service returns the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set to the exact user portal domain (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSNotSupportingCredentials[wildcard `*` is not allowed in this case]).
* Before production deployment, verify that the API service and form settings fully comply with CORS policy requirements, including proper domain whitelisting.

[#_fr_05]
=== FR-05. Map component. Non-standard tile servers
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
When using non-standard tile servers for the base map layer, you must configure the server to update the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) response header.

NOTE: As of writing, the standard tile servers are `tile.openstreetmap.org` and `visicom.ua`.

Impact ::
Without proper server configuration, the browser will block tile server requests,
causing the map component to malfunction.

Recommendations ::
* Prepare and configure the server environment in advance if non-standard tile servers will be used.

NOTE: As of writing, the `Content-Security-Policy` configuration is set in the `deploy-templates/templates/kong-response-transformer-plugin.yaml` file in the `common-web-app` repository.

[#_fr_06]
=== FR-06. Experimental components
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
Form builder components in the _Regulation Modeling Web Interface_ are divided into three categories:

* *Updated* — components adapted to the solution and cabinet design, maintained and tested by the Platform development team.
* *Experimental* — standard Form.io components not adapted for the Platform, not maintained or tested by the Platform team.
* *Components* — outdated custom components that are no longer maintained.

When modeling forms, you should prioritize using components from the *Updated* category.

Impact ::
* The form functionality cannot be guaranteed when using components from the *Experimental* or *Components* categories.

Recommendations ::
* Use components only from the *Updated* category.
* If the use of other categories is justified, carefully evaluate the risks and perform extensive testing.
* Avoid manually changing the type of *Experimental* or *Components* items to match *Updated* ones after code adjustments, as this can lead to unpredictable behavior and break functionality.

[#_fr_07]
=== FR-07. Limits on search conditions for the _Select_ component
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
When using the *Select* component integrated with registry reference books via search criteria or external services, always specify a `limit` parameter in the component settings.
In production, the amount of data may be much larger than in testing, and setting a limit helps avoid performance problems.

Impact ::
Fetching large datasets into a *Select* component without limits can lead to:

* Unnecessary load on the relational database.
* Unnecessary load on the synchronous data management service.
* Increased form rendering time.

Recommendations ::
* Set the `limit` parameter in the *Select* component to the minimum necessary for correct form functionality.
* Avoid using the *Disable limiting response* parameter unless strictly justified.

[#_fr_08]
=== FR-08. Mathematical calculations
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
All critical mathematical calculations, especially financial ones, should be performed on the server side using DMN tables or business processes.

Impact ::
* Results of client-side calculations cannot be trusted and may be compromised.
* The *Number* component uses the JavaScript `Number` type, which is inaccurate for financial calculations and can produce unsafe results with large numbers.

Recommendations ::
* Perform critical mathematical calculations in DMN tables or business processes.
* Optionally duplicate simple calculations client-side for better user experience, but always ignore client-side results on the server.

[#_fr_09]
=== FR-09. Input mask on text fields
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
You can apply an input mask to a text field component to simplify user input.
To ensure proper form pre-filling, input values must match the field's mask format.

Impact ::
* If a masked field is improperly pre-filled, the user will not be able to submit or sign the form, preventing business process completion.
* The user will not be able to complete user tasks if:
** The text field has an input mask.
** The text field is configured as non-editable.
** Pre-filled data does not match the mask format.

Recommendations ::
* Validate pre-filled data in business processes for fields that use masks.
* Pay extra attention to external system data that may not conform to input masks.
* Consider avoiding masks altogether, or use masks for input only while disabling them for pre-filled data.

[#_fr_10]
=== FR-10. Edit Grid
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
When using the *Edit Grid* component,
note that complex logic inside nested components can significantly impact form rendering performance,
especially with many table rows.
This applies both to read-only mode (data prepared in business processes) and edit mode (user-entered data).

NOTE: In this section, the terms *Table* and *Edit Grid* are used interchangeably.

Impact ::
Increased form rendering time due to:
* Search condition queries being executed for each table row.
(For example, 100 rows with 3 *Select* fields will generate 300 search queries.)
* File search queries executed against the _Digital Document Service_ for each file associated with a table row.
(Client-side requests occur once per table, but server-side processing complexity is O(n)).

Recommendations ::
* Use the *Optimize column render* setting (under *Data* tab) in the *Edit Grid* component.
It disables complex client-side logic (JavaScript validation, conditional visibility, computed values, and search queries).
* Avoid displaying files inside *Edit Grid* if data was prepared via business processes.
Instead, use a separate form with a detailed card view for file access.
* Minimize displayed data:
** Reduce the number of rows to the minimal necessary amount. Consider using reports if you need to work with all data.
** Reduce the number of columns. Use a separate form for detailed row information if needed.

[#_fr_11]
=== FR-11. Data types
IMPORTANT: Criticality: High

Description ::
When using the *Edit Grid* component, make sure that the data types displayed in the table match the data types provided by the business process.
Each column in the _Edit Grid_ has its own dedicated component, and these components must align with the corresponding data types.
For example, to display `string` values, you should use the _Text Field_ or _Textarea_ components.
Similar issues can also arise when using mismatched components outside of _Edit Grid_.

Impact ::
Selecting an incorrect component for displaying data can lead to:
* Failure to display data.
* Incorrect or inconsistent data display.
* Problems using the search function inside the _Edit Grid_.
* Complete malfunction of the form or the _Edit Grid_.

Recommendations ::
For each data type, use only the components that match it. See the mapping table below.
