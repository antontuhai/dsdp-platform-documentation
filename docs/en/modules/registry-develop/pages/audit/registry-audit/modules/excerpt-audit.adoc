[#_ex_01]
=== EX-01. Data sets for extracts
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
During extract template testing, it is important to verify extracts with different data sets and volumes close to production-level scenarios.
Certain scenarios where template elements move to a new page depending on the data volume may not be covered during development.

Impact ::
* Some template elements, such as tables, might be incorrectly positioned on a page depending on the amount of data.

Recommendations ::
* Test extracts with different data volumes that cause template elements to move to a new page.
* Fix potential issues and adapt templates to properly handle element movement across pages.

[#_ex_02]
=== EX-02. Required parameters in excerpt templates
IMPORTANT: Criticality: Medium

Description ::
When modeling extract templates, remember that all incoming parameters are considered required by default.

Impact ::
If a required parameter is not provided when requesting extract generation from a business process, the generation will fail with an error that may be difficult to diagnose.

Recommendations ::
* Classify extract template input parameters as required or optional.
* For required parameters, add validation in the business process before calling extract generation.
* For optional parameters, ensure the template can handle their absence and consider setting default values, such as the "-" symbol.
