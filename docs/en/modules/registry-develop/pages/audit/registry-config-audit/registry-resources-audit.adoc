This document provides recommendations and configuration rules for registries to ensure stability, scalability, and performance.

*Audit scope* — registry resource configuration.

[#_rs_01]
== RS-01. Container resources

=== Overview

Description ::

To ensure stable operation of the Kubernetes cluster, it is critical to properly configure resources for each container — *memory and CPU*.
This prevents excessive resource consumption by individual containers and ensures efficient resource allocation among services.

Recommendations ::

* Set identical *Request* and *Limit* values for container memory in OKD/Kubernetes.
This prevents containers from consuming more resources than expected and negatively impacting node stability.

* Use *_no more than 3 replicas_* of a single service.
Especially for Java applications, it is more efficient to scale vertically (increase resources per replica) rather than horizontally.
Each additional replica significantly increases memory usage and decreases overall resource efficiency.

Impact ::

* If memory limits are not set, a container could exceed node resources under load, causing performance degradation or crashes of other containers.

* Using more than 3 replicas for a Java service significantly increases memory consumption, inefficiently distributing resources and degrading overall system performance.

=== Audit scope

*Audit scope* — running containers in the registry.
Only containers consuming more than 100 MB of memory are considered. One-time pipeline containers (Jobs) and low-memory containers are excluded.
Containers are sorted by actual memory consumption, from highest to lowest.

[#_rs_02]
== RS-02. Virtual machines size and quantity

=== Overview

Description ::

Effective management of virtual machine size and quantity is key to ensuring OKD/Kubernetes cluster stability and fault tolerance.
Proper resource distribution helps prevent overloads and simplifies future scaling.

Recommendations ::

* The total memory allocated across all services (Requests and Limits) should not exceed 80% of the memory available on the virtual machines. This ensures resource safety margins for stable operation.

* Add one additional virtual machine (+1) for fault tolerance. This allows rapid recovery in case of a machine failure or increased load.

* Prioritize vertical scaling (increasing resources per machine) over horizontal scaling to optimize memory and CPU usage.

* Highly loaded services should be deployed on dedicated (exclusive) virtual machines to avoid conflicts and ensure higher system stability.

=== Audit scope

*Audit scope* — virtual machines allocated for the registry and heavily loaded services that may require exclusive nodes.

== RS-03. Resources for Java applications

=== Overview

Description::
Java applications require specific memory and resource settings due to the nature of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) operation.
Proper configuration is critical for stable operation and high performance when running in containers.

Recommendations::

* Prefer vertical scaling (increasing resources for a single instance) over horizontal scaling.
* Always explicitly configure Java heap memory by setting both the initial (`-Xms`) and maximum (`-Xmx`) heap sizes.
* Set identical values for the initial and maximum heap sizes (`-Xms = -Xmx`).
* Limit the number of available CPUs with the `-XX:ActiveProcessorCount` option.
* Calculate heap memory using the formula:
+
----
Heap = min(RAM × 0.75, RAM - 0.5 GB)
----
where RAM is the total container memory.

Examples::
+
* 1 GB RAM container: heap = 500 MB
* 4 GB RAM container: heap = 3 GB

Impact::

Incorrect heap memory settings can cause:

* frequent garbage collection pauses;
* `OutOfMemoryError` occurrences;
* unstable application behavior;
* inefficient memory usage.

== RS-04. Database

=== Overview

Description::
Proper database configuration is critical for registry stability. It involves optimizing connection pools, resources, storage sizing, and PostgreSQL tuning.

Recommendations::

* Ensure that the total client connection pool is lower than the database’s max connections limit by at least 10%.
* For high-load cases, deploy the database on a dedicated VM.
* Size the database storage according to expected data volume and growth rate.
* Calculate connection pool size based on:
** number of concurrent users;
** nature of queries;
** transaction duration;
** peak load scenarios.
* Adjust PostgreSQL parameters for available resources:
** maximum WAL size;
** shared buffers size;
** effective cache size.
* Use native (thin) disks for better I/O performance.

Impact::

Misconfigured database resources can lead to:

* connection timeouts;
* system bottlenecks;
* overall registry instability.

[#_rs_06]
== RS-06. Kafka

=== Overview

* Use at least 3 Kafka brokers in the cluster.
* Calculate the Kafka storage size (`storage`) based on the specific needs of the registry.
* For topics containing historical events (`bpm-history-process`, `bpm-history-task`), configure at least 15 partitions.
* The parallelism factor for the historical event processing service (`process-history-service-persistence`) must be at least 15.
This parameter is determined by the number of service replicas and the `_data-platform.kafka.consumer.concurrency` setting (in the Config Map).

=== Audit scope

*Audit scope* — Kafka and the Process History Persistence Service configuration.
