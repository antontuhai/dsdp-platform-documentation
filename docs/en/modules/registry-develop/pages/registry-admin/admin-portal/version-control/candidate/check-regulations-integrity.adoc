= Integrity check for change requests to registry regulations
include::DSDP:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

== Problem overview

The components of the xref:arch:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/registry-regulation/registry-regulation.adoc[Digital registry regulations] contain internal dependencies, which were previously only partially validated.
This caused delays in identifying errors when making changes to the regulation.

== General description

The Platform supports an extended validation system to ensure checks for the following:

* Dependencies between directories
* Dependencies in business process delegates
* Dependencies for business process JUEL functions

[NOTE]
====
*Integral change request* is a change request after which all registry regulation components retain valid internal dependencies.

For example, when using a delegate in a business process to create an entity, the system can check for the existence of the corresponding table in the data model.
If such a table is missing, the change request is considered non-integral and cannot be merged into the `master` branch of registry regulations.
====

== Checking directory dependencies in the registry regulation

In the *Admin Portal* web interface, a developer can modify an existing business process or create a new one using a candidate version.

For example, when editing a form containing a search query, on the *Data* tab of the xref:registry-develop:bp-modeling/forms/components/select/select-overview.adoc[*Select*] component,
you enter and save an incorrect integration point name that does not exist in the data model:

* Correct value:
`+++<b style="color: green;">/officer/api/data-factory/factor-all</b>+++`

* Incorrect value:
`+++<b style="color: orange;">/api/data-factory/folders</b>+++`

== Checking dependencies for business process JUEL functions

When using a *Script Task*, a developer can use JUEL functions inside the script
(see details: xref:bp-modeling/bp/modeling-facilitation/modelling-with-juel-functions.adoc[]).

For example, if you provide a JUEL function with an incorrect task identifier and save it:

* Correct value: `submission('signRequest+++<b style="color: green;">DataFormActivity</b>+++')`

* Incorrect value: `submission('signRequest+++<b style="color: orange;">FolderFormActivity</b>+++')`

== Checking dependencies when using standard business process extensions

A regulation developer can use a standard extension in a *Service Task*.
For example, the *Create entity in data factory* extension (see details: xref:bp-modeling/bp/element-templates/service-task-templates/create-entity.adoc[]),
where the *Resource* field must specify the resource (table name) where the data will be saved.

For example, you specify a value that does not exist in the database:

== Validation errors in the regulation change application pipeline logs

During the *MASTER-Code-review-registry-regulations* pipeline execution,
an additional validation step is run, highlighted in yellow, signaling detected errors with details stored in the logs.

[NOTE]
====
This means that after entering invalid data into a JUEL function, standard extension, or search query,
the system checks these values and displays the task identifiers with the corresponding errors.

The same validation is performed in the *MASTER-Build-registry-regulations* pipeline when applying invalid changes to the master version of the regulations.
