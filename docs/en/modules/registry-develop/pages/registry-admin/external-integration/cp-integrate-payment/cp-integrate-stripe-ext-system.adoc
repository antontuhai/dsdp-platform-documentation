== Overview

*_Stripe_* is a powerful online payment processing tool that businesses of all sizes use. Integrating Stripe allows you to accept payments directly on your platform, providing a seamless checkout experience for your users. This document outlines the steps to configure Stripe within your system, utilizing the Control Plane administrative console to ensure secure and efficient payment processing.

== Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have administrative access to the
include::DSDP:ROOT:partial$templates/links/platform/administrative/control-plane.adoc[]
and the necessary permissions to manage registries and deploy services. It would help to have an active Stripe account ready to link with your system.

== General description

Several configurations are required at the registry instance level within the Control Plane administrative console to integrate Stripe for handling payment tasks in user portals and receiving updates on payment statuses. These configurations allow for deploying a *Service Entry*, facilitating outbound traffic from the Platform cluster, and creating a secret key for secure communication with Stripe.

[TIP]
====
* The system automatically creates *Service Entry* when deploying the registry via the Jenkins pipeline ‚Äî *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`*. Service entries are required to establish communication with services hosted on external systems.
* Secrets like tokens and passwords are also generated automatically post-configuration via the Jenkins pipeline ‚Äî *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`*. These are stored securely in `user-management:hashicorp-vault` for systems/services requiring external requests.

`<registry-name>` is the name of a registry where you apply your configuration. For instance, `abc-01`.

== Creating the Stripe account

To create an account in the *Stripe* payment system, please follow these steps:

. Visit the https://dashboard.stripe.com/login[] page and create an account. You can find detailed instructions on creating a Stripe account at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/account[official documentation].
+

. After successfully setting up your account, log in to your dashboard and click on the *Developers* section.
+

[start=3]
[#key-tokens]
. Go to the *API keys* section to find your key tokens, including the _Publishable key_ and _Secret key_. Save both of these keys, as you will need them to set up future integration in the Control Plane console and registry Payment User Task.

[#stripe-integration-in-cp]
== Setting up external integration in the Control Plane

This section provides an example of integrating with the *Stripe* external payment system.

. Sign in to the
include::DSDP:ROOT:partial$templates/links/platform/administrative/control-plane.adoc[]
console as a registry administrator.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-login-page.png[]

. Navigate to the *Registries* section and open your registry.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only configure external integrations when editing a registry.

Here is the general procedure: ::
.. Create a registry if you haven't already.
.. Then an administrator can configure external integrations.
.. After the configuration is applied, the Service Entry and the service authorization secret are deployed automatically.
====
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-registries-page.png[]
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-registry-page.png[]

. Expand the *Settings for interaction with other systems* section and click *`Add external system`*.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-add-external-system-button.png[]

. In the *Add external system for interaction* window that appears, configure the external integration with the payment system.
+
NOTE: Network access policies are created automatically.

* *External system name*: Enter external system name -- `stripe`.
+
[CAUTION]
====
Ensure the system name is entered as shown above. It is critical for integration and cannot be modified once the registry configuration is applied.
====
* *External system address*: Enter the base URL of the Stripe payment server to connect to -- `https://api.stripe.com`.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-add-external-system-popup.png[]

* *Integration protocol*: `REST`.

* *Specify the authentication type*: `*AUTH_TOKEN*`.

* *Specify authorization token*: Enter the saved _Secret key_ obtained during the xref:#key-tokens[Stripe account creation].
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-add-external-system-popup-filled.png[]

. Click *`Add`* to save the settings.
+
As a result, the system creates a registry configuration update request.

. In the registry settings, scroll down to the *Change requests* section and click the view icon üëÅ to open your request.
+
NOTE: The system automatically confirms and saves the changes to the registry configuration _deploy-templates/values.yaml_ file.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-registry-edit-created.png[]

. Review the parameters added to the configurations in the *Change request* window.
+
TIP: The comparison window provides a convenient way of reviewing the differences between the current (left) and the new (right) versions.
+
In our example, the configuration looks as follows:

====
Review the integration settings for the selected system. +
You can edit or cancel these settings using edit (üñâ) or delete (üóë) icons.

====
+
As a result, the *MASTER-Build-`<registry-name>`* pipeline starts. It applies the integration settings you provided.
+
. Wait until the build is completed. It may take up to 15 minutes. Use the link in the *CI* column to monitor the build status and result.

+
[#result-service-entry]
[start=9]
. Once the build is completed successfully, the system will apply your configuration and create a new Service Entry in your registry project. +
You can check the result in the menu:Openshift console[Home > Search > ServiceEntries]. Select the necessary `ServiceEntry` resource, choose the project with your registry, find the `stripe` serviceEntry, and open the YAML tab.
+
As a result, you can observe the service entry created and connected to the `api.stripe.com` host, indicating that the integration has been successfully established.

== Business process modeling: Integrating _publishable keys_ in the Stripe Payment User Form task

Once integration with the payment system in Control Plane is completed, the final setup in the Administrative portal should be applied.

. Navigate to the *Quick links* tab in the Control Plane console and refer to the Registry modeling web interface (Administrative portal) in the Registry Administration Zone section.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/cp-registry-quick-links.png[]
+
. Log in as a registry administrator to the Administrative portal.
. Navigate to menu:Process models[List of business processes] and click on *`Create new process`* button. Use the *Create candidate version* option to work with your process in a separate git branch. Alternatively, you may proceed in the master version of the registry regulations.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/ap-process-models.png[]
+
. Navigate to the *Builder* tab of the new process and create a User Task. Apply the appropriate template‚Äîthe *Stripe Payment User form*.
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/ap-process-builder-user-task.png[]
+
image:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-integrate-payment/ap-stripe-payment-element-template.png[]
+
. Set up the element template as follows:
* *Form key*: Enter the form key corresponding to the form service name.
* *Stripe Publishable Key*: Enter the value of *Publishable key* taken from Stripe account's API keys before.
* *Currency*: Select appropriate value from the dropdown target currency -- `USD`, `EUR` or `UAH`.
* *Charge amount*: Enter an amount to be charged in the business process.
+
NOTE: Enter the amount to be charged without using a thousand separators. Use either a dot (`.`) or a comma (`,`) as the decimal separator. The amount must be positive and cannot be zero.

. Save all changes for the business process and apply them to the master branch.
+
