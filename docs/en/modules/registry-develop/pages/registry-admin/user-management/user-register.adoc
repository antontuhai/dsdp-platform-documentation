= User registration in the registry
include::DSDP:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

This guide will help you set up user registration in the
include::DSDP:ROOT:partial$templates/links/platform/operational/keycloak.adoc[]
service of your registry. Digital Services Development Platform supports operation in various regions and countries, providing authentication through login and password in user portals.

== Setting up user registration

The Digital Services Development Platform offers global region settings for registries. The specific configuration of each registry is stored in the *_deploy-templates/values.yml_* file. If the `region` parameter is set to `global`, it means that the registry administrator can configure user registration for two realms -- `officer` and `citizen`.

=== Realm officer-portal

. Open *Realm Settings* and go to the *Login* tab.
. Enable the *User registration* option by switching it to `ON`. This allows enabling self-registration access in the User Portal (`officer-portal`).
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the *User registration* option is disabled, excluding the possibility of user self-registration.

For the `officer` realm, when the *User registration* parameter is disabled, there is no registration link on the authentication page, so the administrator must manually create accounts. Otherwise, when *User registration* is enabled, users can register themselves.

=== Realm citizen-portal

. Open *Realm Settings* and go to the *Login* tab.
. Enable the *User registration* option by switching it to `ON`. This allows enabling self-registration access in the Service Recipient Cabinet (`citizen-portal`).
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the *User registration* option is disabled, excluding the possibility of user self-registration.

For the `citizen` realm, when the *User registration* parameter is disabled, there is no registration link on the authentication page. Otherwise, when *User registration* is enabled, users can register themselves.
====
+
CAUTION: For the `citizen` realm, it is _always_ necessary to enable *User registration* so that users can register themselves.

== Setting up default roles

=== Realm officer-portal

. Open the *Roles* section and go to role settings.
. Go to the *Default Roles* tab.
. Select the `officer` role from the *Available roles* list and click *`Add selected`*. The added role will appear in the *Realm Default Roles* list and be assigned by default.

+

=== Realm citizen-portal

. Open the *Roles* section and go to role settings.
. Go to the *Default Roles* tab.
. Select the `citizen` role from the *Available roles* list and click *`Add selected`*. The added role will appear in the *Realm Default Roles* list and be assigned by default.

== Manually creating users (_for service providers_)

CAUTION: For the `citizen` realm, it is _always_ necessary to enable *User registration* so that service recipients can register themselves.

To manually create a service provider account (realm `officer`), follow these steps:

. Open the `officer` realm and go to the *Users* section.
. Click *`Add user`* to create a new user.
. Provide the following user registration attributes:
+
[cols="2,2,2,2", options="header"]

|-

| *First Name*

| `John`
|-

| *Last Name*

== Checking registration and login to the portals

Users who have successfully completed the self-registration process or were registered by an administrator gain access to the system. They can view the available services corresponding to their roles and actively participate in business processes.

. New users initially land on the registration form, where they must enter their personal information to create an account in the system:

* *First name* -- First Name
* *Last name* -- Last Name
* *Email* -- Email Address
* *Username* -- Username
* *Password* -- Password
* *Confirm password* -- Confirm Password

. After completing the form, users click the *`Register`* button to complete the registration process.
