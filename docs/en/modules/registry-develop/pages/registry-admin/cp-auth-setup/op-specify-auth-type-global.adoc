As a registry administrator, you can configure external authentication for the Service Provider and Service Recipient Portals using an external identity provider (IDP) via the OpenID Connect protocol. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up this feature.

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/global-specific-en.adoc[]

== Access the user portal settings

NOTE: For example, we will consider the configuration process for the *Officer Portal*.

. Open
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/links/platform/administrative/control-plane.adoc[]
and navigate to the registry editing mode.

. Select either the *Officer Portal* or *Citizen Portal* tab, depending on the requirement.

== Specify the authentication type

NOTE: The configuration of an alternative authentication method is done in the Control Plane admin panel separately for each portal.

. Locate the field labeled *Specify authentication type*.
. Open the drop-down list and choose one of the following options:

* **Basic Auth** (_default_) — Users are authenticated according to the existing implementation.
* **External IDP (OIDC)** — Users are authenticated through an external identity provider using the OpenID Connect protocol.

[NOTE]
====
By default, **Basic Auth** is selected, meaning user authentication follows the current implementation.

== Configure external identity provider (IDP) settings

If you selected *External IDP*, follow these steps to configure the necessary settings:

=== Prerequisites

Ensure the following preconditions are met before proceeding:

* The client configuration must be preconfigured in the external identity provider.
* The interaction between external and internal providers should be properly configured.

=== Required fields

Fill in the following mandatory fields with information from the external provider’s client configuration:

//TODO: Add appropriate examples
[cols="15%,65%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter/Field |Description |Example

|*Authorization URL*
|The Authorization URL is the endpoint of the external identity provider where the authentication process begins. This URL redirects users to a login page where they enter their credentials. The identity provider uses this URL to initiate the process of obtaining authorization from the user.
|`https://idp.example.com/auth`

|*Token URL* (_of the created client_)
|The Token URL is the endpoint where the authorization code is exchanged for an access token, allowing the client to authenticate further requests.
|`https://idp.example.com/token`

|*Client ID*
|The Client ID is a unique identifier assigned to your application by the external identity provider. It identifies the application requesting authentication.
|`my-application-client-id`

|*Client Secret*
|The Client Secret is a confidential key used to authenticate your application’s request for a token.
|`my-client-secret`

=== Optional fields

The following fields are optional and do not currently affect the authentication process:

//TODO: Add appropriate examples

[cols="15%,65%,20%",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter/Field |Description |Example

|*Issuer*
|The Issuer is a unique identifier for the external identity provider, typically representing the provider's URL.
|`https://idp.example.com`

|*Logout URL*
|The Logout URL is the endpoint used for terminating the session with the external identity provider.
|`https://idp.example.com/logout`

|*User Info URL*
|The User Info URL is used to retrieve additional user information after authentication.
|`https://idp.example.com/userinfo`

|Toggle: *Backchannel Logout*
|The toggle enables or disables the *Backchannel Logout* feature, which ensures session termination across all platforms.
|Enabled/Disabled

== Confirm and apply changes

. Once all required fields are filled in, click the *Confirm* button.

. Navigate to the *Change Requests* section and confirm the changes.
. Wait for the successful build to complete. The registry components will be updated, and the user portal will start using the external identity provider for authentication.

== Important notes

* Users created using *Basic Auth* will not be able to authenticate after switching to *External IDP*.
* After authentication via the external identity provider, a new user is automatically created in the corresponding Keycloak realm with fake values for service attributes `fullName`, `drfo`, and `edrpou` and the default role of either `citizen` or `officer`.
* *User management* is performed at the level of the external IDP system.
* *Role management* for users authenticated via the external IDP is performed at the registry level in the corresponding realms.
