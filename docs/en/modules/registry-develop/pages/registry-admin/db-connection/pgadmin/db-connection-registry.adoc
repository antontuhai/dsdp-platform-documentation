== Overview

This guide explains how to connect to the registry database using *pgAdmin* for data browsing, analysis, and maintenance.
It covers connection instructions for different user roles, such as `application_role` and `registry_owner_role`.

== Access requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

* Access to the *Control Plane* admin panel.
* Access to the appropriate *OpenShift* project.
* Permissions to view *Secrets* in that project, specifically:
** `pgadmin-secret` — for accessing the *pgAdmin* interface.
** `citus-roles-secrets` — for connecting with `application_role` and `registry_owner_role`.

== How to open pgAdmin

. Sign in to the *Control Plane* admin panel.
. Navigate to menu:Registries[Quick links > Registry Admin Zone] and follow the link to the *Registry Data Viewer* — *pgAdmin*.

[NOTE]
====
*To find your pgAdmin login credentials:*

Go to menu:Workloads[Secrets] and open the secret named `pgadmin-secret`.
It contains the login and password for accessing the interface.

== Connecting as `application_role`

To log in using the `application_role` system user, configure the connection settings for the *Registry* server:

In *pgAdmin*, expand the *Servers* section and select the *Registry* server.
Enter the password for `application_role` to establish the connection.

[NOTE]
====
* The password for `application_role` is stored in the `citus-roles-secrets` (menu:Workloads[Secrets]).
* Use the value from the `appRolePass` field.

== Connecting as `registry_owner_role`

To log in as `registry_owner_role` (registry owner), update the connection settings for the *Registry* server:

. In *pgAdmin*, go to menu:Servers[Registry > Properties].
+

. Switch to the *Connection* tab. In the *Username* field, enter `registry_owner_role` and save the changes.

[NOTE]
====
* The password for `registry_owner_role` is also stored in the `citus-roles-secrets` secret.
* Use the value from the `regOwnerPass` field.

== Role and secret summary

Use the appropriate credentials from OpenShift secrets when connecting via *pgAdmin*:

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Role |Secret |Field |Description

|`application_role` |`citus-roles-secrets` |`appRolePass` | System user
|`registry_owner_role` |`citus-roles-secrets` |`regOwnerPass` | Registry owner
|===

TIP: For more details on database users, see xref:arch:architecture/registry/operational/relational-data-storage/db-roles.adoc[].

== Viewing the database structure

Locate the operational database named `registry`.
It can be found under:
menu:Servers[Registry > Databases > `registry`]

[NOTE]
====
To learn more about working with temporary databases, see xref:registry-develop:best-practices/review-db-changes-before-merge.adoc[].

=== Viewing tables

To view database tables, navigate to:
menu:Schemas[`registry` > Tables]

image:registry-admin/db-connection/pgadmin/db-connection-pgadmin-3.png[]

=== Viewing search conditions

To view search conditions, navigate to:
menu:Schemas[`registry` > Views]

image:registry-admin/db-connection/pgadmin/db-connection-pgadmin-4.png[]

[NOTE]
====
*Search conditions* are read-only database views used in the registry's data model.

The names of these views correspond to the names in the data model, with the `_v` suffix added.

*Example:* `get_parent_by_name` → `get_parent_by_name_v`
