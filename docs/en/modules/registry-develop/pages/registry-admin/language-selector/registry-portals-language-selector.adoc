The language selection feature allows users of the registry web portals to dynamically choose the interface language using a selector located at the top of the web interface. This feature is available in the following interfaces:

* Officer Portal
* Citizen Portal
* Administrative Portal

All available languages in the selector are based on the *`global.supportedLanguages`* setting in the registry configuration.

== Language availability and settings

The language selector is located at the top of the client application interface. It's available on every page and lets you select one of the supported languages. The list of languages is generated based on the registry configuration, specifically the `global.supportedLanguages` parameter.

== Saving the selected language

The selected language is stored in a cookie called `Language`, which is automatically updated when you change the language in the selector. The selected language is applied in real time to update the interface.

== Automatic language detection upon application load

When the application loads, the system checks for the presence and value of the `Language` cookie:

* If the cookie exists and its value matches one of the supported languages, that language is automatically selected in the selector and applied to the interface.
* If the cookie is missing or its value doesn't match a supported language, the system creates a new `Language` cookie with the default language (set by the `global.language` parameter) and applies that language.

== Real-time language application

Changes to the language setting are applied immediately without requiring a page reload. This ensures a seamless user experience with instant updates to the interface language.

== Forming HTTP requests

When making requests to backend services, the client application adds the `Accept-Language` HTTP header to each request with the current user's language value.

== Localizing error messages

The `form-submission-validation` service processes the `Accept-Language` header and uses its value to localize error messages during form validation.

== Preserving the language choice for future sessions

The selected language is saved in the `Language` cookie. On your next login, the interface will automatically display in the previously selected language.
