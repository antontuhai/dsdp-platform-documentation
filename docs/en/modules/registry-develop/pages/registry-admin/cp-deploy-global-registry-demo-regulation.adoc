= Deploying a demo registry with reference examples for the _global_ region
include::DSDP:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

== Overview

You can deploy a *demo registry* on the Platform that includes reference examples for modeling registry regulations.
These regulations follow the same structure as the standard regulations used in any registry deployed on the Platform.

The demo registry includes:

* Reference examples: prefixed with `reference-`
* Testing examples: prefixed with `feature-`

These can include:

* `.bpmn` business process diagrams
* `.json` forms for submitting process data
* `.xml` schemas for deploying the registry data model
* and more

[NOTE]
====
These reference examples and other provided samples are developed by the Platform core team.
They are regularly updated and expanded with each new release, helping you:

* Stay up to date with the latest practices and trends.
* Experiment and test various scenarios in a controlled environment.
====

== Deploying the demo registry and regulations

Follow these steps to deploy the demo registry and copy the sample regulations.

[step-1]
=== Step 1: Create the _demo_ registry

Create a new registry named `demo` by following the instructions at:
xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-create-registry.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
To complete this process, make sure the Platform administrator is added as a registry administrator during creation under the *Administrators* section.

When deploying in the *global* region, sections like *Key data* and *Data for signature verification* do not include region-specific keys or certificates.

====

[step-2]
=== Step 2: Access Platform-specific Gerrit component

. Open the *Control Plane* admin console.
. Go to menu:Platform management[Quick links > Platform administrative zone] and follow the link to the *Gerrit* central component.
+
.Platform management. Quick links
image::admin:registry-management/cp-platform-mgmt-quick-links-en.png[]

. In your Gerrit account settings, find the *HTTP credentials* section.
+
.Gerrit. User settings
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-2.png[]

. Generate a new HTTP password and save it to a notebook.
+
.Gerrit. HTTP credentials
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-2-1.png[]
+
NOTE: You’ll need this HTTP password later when cloning the `global-registry-demo-regulation` Gerrit repository.

[step-3]
=== Step 3: Clone the _global-registry-demo-regulation_ repository

. In Gerrit, go to menu:Browse[Repositories] and use the *Filter* field to find the *`global-registry-demo-regulation` repository*.
+
.Gerrit. Search repo
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-global-registry-demo-regulation/cp-deploy-global-registry-demo-regulation-3.png[]

. Clone the repository to your local machine:

.. Select the *Anonymous HTTP* tab (default) and copy the *Clone with commit-msg hook* command.
+
.Gerrit. Clone repo with hook
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-4.png[]
+
[NOTE]
====
Why use `commit-msg hook`? ::

Gerrit uses *hooks*—scripts that run before or after certain Git events, such as before `git commit` or `git push`.
+
The *Clone with commit-msg hook* command automatically adds the `commit-msg hook` to your local repository.
This hook generates a unique *Change-Id* for each commit, which Gerrit uses to track change versions.

====

.. Open https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git Bash] and navigate to the target directory:
+
.Navigate to the target directory
[source,bash]
----
cd <path/to/your/local/directory>
----

.. Paste the copied *Clone with commit-msg hook* command and press *Enter*.
+
.Git Bash. Clone repo with hook
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-5.png[]

.. Wait for the repository to finish cloning.
+

[step-4]
=== Step 4: Access the registry-specific Gerrit component

. Open the *Control Plane* admin console.
. Go to menu:Registries[Quick links > Registry administration zone] and follow the link to the *Gerrit* component for the demo registry.
+
.Registries. Quick links
image::admin:registry-management/quick-links/quick-links-2-en.png[]

. In your Gerrit account settings, find the *HTTP credentials* section.
+
.Gerrit. User settings
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-2.png[]

. Generate a new HTTP password and save it.
+
.Gerrit HTTP credentials
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-2-1.png[]
+
NOTE: You’ll need this HTTP password for authentication when cloning and interacting with the `registry-regulations` Gerrit repository.

[step-5]
=== Step 5: Clone the _registry-regulations_ repository

. In Gerrit, go to menu:Browse[Repositories] and use the *Filter* field to find the *`registry-regulations` repository*.
+
NOTE: After you deploy the registry, the `registry-regulations` repository is initially empty. You need to populate it further.

. Clone the repository to your local machine:

.. Select the *Anonymous HTTP* tab (default) and copy the *Clone with commit-msg hook* command.
+
[NOTE]
====
Why use `commit-msg hook`? ::

Gerrit uses *hooks*—scripts that run before or after certain Git events, such as before `git commit` or `git push`.
+
The *Clone with commit-msg hook* command automatically adds the `commit-msg hook` to your local repository.
This hook generates a unique *Change-Id* for each commit, which Gerrit uses to track change versions.
====

.. Open https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git Bash] and navigate to your target directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd <path/to/your/local/directory>
----

.. Paste the copied *Clone with commit-msg hook* command and press *Enter*.

.. Wait for the repository to finish cloning.

[step-6]
=== Step 6: Copy the demo regulations content

On your local machine, copy the content of the `global-registry-demo-regulation` repository and paste it (replacing contents) into the `registry-regulations` repository.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to copy only the content, without the `.git` system folder.

[step-7]
=== Step 7: Publish the changes

NOTE: At this step, you are populating the `registry-regulations` online Gerrit repository.

. Publish the changes to the demo registry regulations.
After publishing, the regulation entities—such as the data model, business processes, and forms—will be available for use in the user portals:

* *Administrative portal* (`admin-portal`)
* *Officer portal* (`officer-portal`)
* *Citizen portal* (`citizen-portal`)

. Prepare a commit and push it to the `registry-regulations` repository.
In *Git Bash*, run the following commands one by one:

+
.Add changes to the Stage
[source,bash]
----
git add --all
----
This command stages all new, modified, or deleted files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

+
.Commit changes
[source,bash]
----
git commit -m "added demo registry data"
----
This command creates a new commit with the staged changes.
The `-m` flag lets you add a short commit message describing the changes (in this case: `"added demo registry data"`).
+
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-8.png[]

+
.Push changes
[source,bash]
----
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
----
This command pushes the changes to the remote repository.
Here, `origin` refers to the remote repository, and
*`HEAD:refs/for/master`* pushes the current branch for code review before merging into `master`.
This is the Gerrit-specific way of submitting changes for review.
+
.Git Bash. Add, commit and push
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-9.png[]

[step-8]
=== Step 8: Complete the Gerrit review and merge

. After pushing the changes, follow the Gerrit link shown in the terminal.
+
[TIP]
====
The registry-specific Gerrit URL will look like:

----
https://admin-tools-<openshift-project-name>.<dns-wildcard>/gerrit
----

* `<openshift-project-name>` — your registry’s name (in this example, `demo`)
* `<dns-wildcard>` — the OpenShift environment’s domain name
* `gerrit` — the endpoint leading to the Gerrit service in your registry.
====

. Wait for the system code review pipeline *MASTER-Code-review-registry-regulations* to complete.
You can check progress at the bottom of the Gerrit page.
After a successful check, your change request will receive the `Verified +1` status.

. As a moderator, approve the change by clicking the *Code-Review+2* button.
+
.Gerrit. Code review process
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-10.png[]

. Apply the changes to the `master` branch by clicking *Submit* (this performs a `git merge`).
+
This triggers the automatic publishing pipeline — *MASTER-Build-registry-regulations*.
You can monitor the deployment progress in Gerrit.

+
TIP: Once published successfully, the demo registry will include reference examples (prefixed with `reference-`) and testing examples (prefixed with `feature-`).

[step-9]
=== Step 9: (Optional at the initial stage) Configure mock integrations

. The demo registry's regulations include mock integrations with external systems, located in the `mock-integrations` directory.
While this step is optional at the initial deployment stage, we recommend configuring it to enable integration interactions during registry development.

+
.Control Plane. Configure external integration mock
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-global-registry-demo-regulation/cp-deploy-global-registry-demo-regulation-15.png[]

. In the *Control Plane*, select menu:Settings for interaction with other systems[Add external system  > Use external integration mock] and fill in the following values for each integration:
+
[TIP]
====
.External integration mock settings
----
  driving-sc-registry:
    authentication type: AUTH_TOKEN
    authorization token: 2805a4ffd4abdc20013dfc898d71270aee71ed23
  health-registry:
    authentication type: AUTH_TOKEN
    authorization token: 8054d18818efdc6f2c668c759ac72b4c57a1a547

    authentication type: BASIC
    username: testuser
    password: bd3e223a142e8e5119359d1dae196801dcc7513f
----
Each integration must be added individually and will apply after you confirm the *Change Request*.

➡️ For detailed setup instructions, see xref:registry-admin/external-integration/cp-mock-integrations.adoc[Setting up mock integrations].
====

[step-10]
=== Step 10: Verify in the Administrative portal

Go to the *Administrative portal* and check that the business processes, UI forms, and other components are available.
Reference examples will have the `reference-` prefix.

TIP: You can find the Administrative portal link in  menu:Control Plane[Registries > `demo` registry > Quick links > Registry modeling web interface (Administrative portal)].

.Administrative portal. Process models
image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-global-registry-demo-regulation/cp-deploy-global-registry-demo-regulation-11.png[]

These reference business processes will also appear as services in the Officer and Citizen portals.

== Understanding the demo registry regulation contents

The demo registry regulation follows the same structure as any standard registry deployed on the Platform.
For details, see xref:arch:architecture/registry/administrative/regulation-management/registry-regulation/registry-regulation.adoc[Digital regulations].

The demo registry includes:

* Reference examples — prefixed with `reference-`
* Testing examples — prefixed with `feature-`

These cover:

* `.bpmn` business process diagrams
* `.json` forms for submitting process data
* `.xml` schemas for deploying the registry data model
* and more

image::registry-admin/cp-deploy-consent-data/cp-deploy-consent-data-6.png[]

=== Setting up officer access

To allow an officer to access the relevant reference processes in the Officer portal, you need to:

1. Create a user in the Keycloak realm named `<registry-name>-officer` (for the demo registry, this is `demo-officer-portal`).
2. Assign the necessary access rights.

Access rights can include general officer roles (such as `officer`) or more specific roles, depending on your registry’s logic.

=== Reviewing roles and permissions

*Roles* are defined in the `roles/*.yml` files:

* Officer roles are listed in `roles/officer.yml`.
* Citizen roles are listed in `roles/citizen.yml`.

.Demo registry `officer` roles
====
.roles/officer.yml
[source,yaml]
----
roles:
  - name: officer
    description: Officer role
----
====

*Authorization rules* are set in the `bp-auth/*.yml` files:

* Officer access is defined in `bp-auth/officer.yml`.
* Citizen access is defined in `bp-auth/citizen.yml`.
* External system access is defined in `bp-auth/external-system.yml`.

.Authorization. Process-to-role mapping example
====

      process_name: 'View digital driving licence'
      process_description: 'View digital driving licence'
      roles:
        - officer
    - process_definition_id: 'reference-officer-driving-licence-excerpt'
      process_name: 'Excerpt digital driving licence'
      process_description: 'Excerpt digital driving licence'
      roles:
        - officer

=== Using mock integrations

The demo registry includes processes that depend on mock integrations with external systems.
For example, the `mock-integrations/population-registry.json` file contains mock user data used in the *Create driving license* process.
