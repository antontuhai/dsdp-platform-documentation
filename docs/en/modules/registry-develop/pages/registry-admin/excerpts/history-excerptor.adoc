== Overview

*_Data history review_* is a mechanism for tracking changes in data and their origin, useful for identifying errors or integrity violations.

The *_Data history excerpt_* function creates a report on changes to a specific database record. The excerpt is generated based on a template that includes system metadata and business data from the table. Business fields are retained in the original form, in Latin characters, and are not part of the template fields (e.g., `user_name`, `birthdate`).

== Regulations configuration

To generate an excerpt, you need to configure the template in the system. Each template must be stored in the appropriate directory and include files for different languages.

=== Configuring excerpt templates

The placement of templates should follow the structure of directories depending on the configured service region:

.Directory structure for the default `-en` template and localized template `-uk`

}
}

[IMPORTANT]
The language value must comply with the *ISO 639-1* standard. For example, `en` for English, `fr` for French, etc.

=== Template selection rules

. If the excerpt is generated for a registry in the global service region, the system will use templates under the directory `*_HistoryExcerpt_*`. The language is configured globally in the registry: menu:Control Plane[Registries > Edit Registry > Localization].

. If the language specified in the request does not match the registry's configured language, the default template will be used (e.g., `*_HistoryExcerpt_*` for the global region or `*_HistoryExcerpt-uk_*` for Ukraine).

. If the registry's language is changed to _Ukrainian_, and the regulations include the directory `*_HistoryExcerpt-uk_*`, this template will be used.

=== Description of template fields

The excerpt template includes the following fields:

=== Business fields included in the excerpt

Business fields in the excerpt may vary for each table and will be specific to each entity. Their display in the excerpt remains unchanged, regardless of the template's language settings (`-en`, `-uk`, etc.).
