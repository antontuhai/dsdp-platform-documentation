== Overview

The Platform Installer lets you set the region parameter when creating a new Platform instance using *`PLATFORM_REGION`*. This parameter ensures the Platform and its registries are tailored to the selected region. After the pipeline completes, the installer creates the Platform instance based on this region. Note that the region value is not visible on the Control Plane and cannot be changed afterward. The same region value applies when you create a new registry. Possible values include:

* *`global`* -- Deploys the Platform instance customized to international service regions, adapting functionalities for global markets.

== Extending the Platform and registries management subsystem (Control Plane) for Global region peculiarities

[NOTE,caption=Region-dependent]
In the Control Plane, under the *Platform management* section, UA-specific tabs remain hidden.

The *Platform management* section displays the following tabs:

* *General*
* *Administrators*
* *Backup*
* *Allowed CIDRS*
* *Keycloak DNS*
* *Documentation*

== Language and localization dependencies

[NOTE,caption=Language-dependent]
The Platform supports selecting a language for the Control Plane interface, which applies to all admin panel pages -- parameter *`PLATFORM_LANGUAGE`*.

Possible values for the `PLATFORM_LANGUAGE` variable:

* *`en`* -- Uses English as the default language for Platform web portals. After deployment, administrators can change the interface language in the Control Plane and Administrative Portal services based on supported localization files.

NOTE: You can also use the `uk` parameter to apply the Ukrainian language, but we recommend using `en` for consistency.

After pipeline completion and Platform instance creation, the selected language is displayed in the *Platform management* section on the *General* tab. The *Regional format* field, which determines date and time display, number formats, and separators, automatically populates based on the selected language (United States or Ukraine). All Control Plane pages are displayed in the chosen language.

The administrator can change the language when editing the Platform. Select the desired value from the *Interface language* dropdown list and confirm the update. After applying the change, the Control Plane interface language will be updated.

When creating a new registry, the language value selected at the Platform level applies. Administrators can change the registry language during or after deployment.

== Registry deployment peculiarities in the Global region

If the `global` service region value is selected at the Platform level, certain differences from the `ua` version apply. Let's review them:

=== Registry User Authentication

[NOTE,caption=Region-dependent]
User authentication in the service provider and recipient cabinet uses login and password.

Instead of EDS and id.gov.ua authentication, the Platform supports user registration and login authentication options. This adapts the *Users and roles management subsystem* according to the configured service region.

[TIP]
See details for user authentication and registration at xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/user-management/user-register.adoc[Registering users].

=== Control Plane Changes to Support the Global Region Peculiarities

[NOTE,caption=Region-dependent]
In the Control Plane, UA-specific tabs and sections remain hidden on the *Registries* tab.

On the *Registries* page under Registry info, the *Interaction settings with registries through Trembita* section does not display. The *Interaction settings with other systems* section does not show prefilled data for integration with the *Diia* system.

Additionally, when creating or editing a registry, the administrator _DOES NOT_ see:

* *Secure exchange gateway (Trembita)* tab
* *Key info* and *Data for signature verification* settings -- These tabs only comment on the possibility of implementing electronic signature functionality (as electronic signatures are country-specific)
* Widgets settings for Officer Portal and Citizen Portal are absent.

=== Language and Localization Dependencies at the Registry Level

[NOTE,caption=Language-dependent]
The language for the *Administrative Portal*, user portals (*Officer* and *Citizen portals*), and Registry analytical reporting subsystem interfaces -- *Redash Admin* (for creating analytical reports) and *Redash Viewer* (for viewing analytical queries and dashboards) can be selected.

The registry interface language can be selected in the Control Plane under the *Registries* section, *General* tab. This tab has a *Localization* section with two values in the *Interface language* dropdown: *`EN-English`* and *`UK-Українська`*. The registry language determines date and time display, number formats, and separators. The *Regional format* field value corresponds to the selected language (Ukraine or the United States).

After applying the changes, the mentioned interfaces in the created registry will display in the selected language. To change the interface language, the administrator must select the desired value from the *Interface language* dropdown list while editing the registry and confirm the Change request. After applying the change, the interfaces' language will be updated.

==== Language Specifics for the Administrative Portal

[NOTE,caption=Language-dependent]
The Administrative Portal interface is displayed in either Ukrainian or English, depending on the language chosen by the registry administrator in the Control Plane.

==== Language Specifics for the Officer and Citizen Portals

[NOTE,caption=Language-dependent]
User portals are translated into English. The language is selected by the registry administrator in the Administrative Portal.

Translated into English:

1. Static page content
2. Placeholders on data entry pages
3. Validation errors in data entry fields on contact channel pages
4. Content on confirmation/cancellation/warning pop-ups
5. Tooltips on yellow tags
6. Status values and other directories used in user cabinets
7. Validation errors on authentication pages
8. Validation errors on signing forms
9. Notifications about non-critical errors (frontend, backend) in user cabinets
10. Texts on loaders
11. The language selected by the registry administrator at the registry level in the Control Plane applies to user portals.

==== Language Specifics for the Redash Admin and Redash Viewer

[NOTE,caption=Language-dependent]
The web interfaces for viewing reports are translated into English and are selected by the registry administrator.

The interfaces for modeling and viewing reports have been translated into English. If the registry administrator in the Control Plane selected English while editing the registry, after applying the Change request, the interfaces for creating and viewing reports will display in this language.

=== Theme Specifics

The theme selected by the modeler in the Administrative Portal also applies to the Officer Portal and Citizen Portal.
