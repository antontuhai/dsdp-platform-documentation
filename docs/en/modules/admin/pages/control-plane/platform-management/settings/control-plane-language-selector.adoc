The language selection feature lets you choose the interface language dynamically using a selector at the top of the web interface. The languages available in the selector are based on the *`global.supportedLanguages`* setting in the platform configuration.

== Language availability and settings

The language selector is at the top of the Control Plane interface. It's available on every page and lets you choose from the supported languages. The list of supported languages is generated from platform settings, specifically the `global.supportedLanguages` parameter.

== Saving the selected language

The selected language is saved in a cookie called `Language`, which is updated automatically when you change the language in the selector. The selected language is applied in real time to update the interface.

== Automatic language detection on portal load

When the portal loads, the system checks for the `Language` cookie:

* If the cookie exists and its value matches one of the supported languages, that language is automatically selected in the selector and applied to the interface.
* If the cookie is missing or its value doesn't match a supported language, the system creates a new `Language` cookie with the default language (set by the `global.language` parameter) and applies that language.

== Real-time language application

Changes to the language setting are applied immediately without requiring a page reload. This ensures a smooth experience with instant updates across the interface.

== Preserving the language choice for future sessions

The selected language is saved in the `Language` cookie. On your next login, the interface will automatically display in the previously selected language.
