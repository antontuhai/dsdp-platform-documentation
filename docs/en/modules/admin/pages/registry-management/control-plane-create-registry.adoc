include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/default-set-en.adoc[]

include::platform:ROOT:partial$admonitions/language-en.adoc[]

This guide explains how to configure and deploy a new registry instance on the Platform.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

Before you begin,
ensure that you have successfully completed the
xref:installation/platform-deployment/platform-deployment-overview.adoc[Platform deployment] in your target environment.

Once the Platform is deployed, a Platform administrator can access the *Control Plane* admin console —
the web interface
for managing the Platform infrastructure (`cluster-mgmt` component) and the individual registry components.

This document walks you through the step-by-step process of configuring
and deploying a registry using the Control Plane interface.

[TIP]
====
You can access the *Control Plane* admin console in two ways:

* *Direct link*:
https://control-plane-console-control-plane-platform-main.<dns-wildcard>[], +
where `<dns-wildcard>` is your cluster’s domain name.

* *Through the OpenShift console*:
https://console-openshift-console.<dns-wildcard>[]. +
In the OKD console, go to menu:Networking[Routes], search for the `control-plane` namespace, and look for the link under the *Location* column.

image::infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/cp-registry-deploy-12.png[]
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only a Platform administrator with appropriate permissions can deploy a registry using the *Control Plane* console.
This action requires a `cp-cluster-mgmt-admin` role in Keycloak's `control-plane-admin` realm.

For details, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-assign-platform-admins.adoc[].
====

To deploy a new registry, follow these steps:

. Sign in to the *Control Plane* admin console.
+
image::admin:infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/update-cluster-mgmt-01.png[]

. Open the *Registries* section and click the *Create New* button.
+
image::infrastructure/cluster-mgmt/cp-registry-deploy-1.png[]

. Configure your registry parameters.

[TIP]
====
Read on for details on each deployment step below.
====

[#general-settings]
== General settings

The *General* section comprises the primary settings for the registry to be created. Here, you can define the registry name, description, deployment mode, and a template for the registry deployment. See each option below.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-1-en.png[]

[reg-name-description]
=== Registry name and description

In this step, you can specify the registry's system name, which is used in various data exchange operations on the Platform. The registry name cannot be changed once the registry is created.

[NOTE]
====
* The *Name* field is required.
* The name must be unique.
* Allowed characters are lowercase Latin letters (`a-z`) and hyphens (`-`).
* The name must not exceed 12 characters.
====

You can describe the purpose of the registry or provide its official name in the *Description* field. This information may be helpful for business or legal reasons.

[deployment-mode]
=== Deployment mode

In this section, you must select the deployment mode of your registry.

NOTE: The *Deployment mode* field is required.

Choose one of two options:

* *development* — installs the registry in the development mode.
* *production* — installs the registry in the production mode.

[WARNING]
====
Once the registry is created, you cannot change the deployment mode.
====

*Deployment mode* indicates the environment in which the registry policy is deployed. It distinguishes between a production environment and a development environment, allowing customization of the configuration according to the needs of each. The Platform supports two modes for registry deployment: *development* and *production*.

*Development mode* provides deployment with settings optimized for ease of development and debugging.

*Production mode* provides a deployment optimized for maximum performance, stability, and security. It eliminates additional debugging tools and provides optimal configuration and settings for working in real conditions on target clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In production mode, along with production versions of the platforms, the following are not deployed:

* Components involved in the development processes of the registry regulations.
* Public endpoints of components involved in the development processes of the registry regulations.
====

[TIP]
Read more about deployment modes on the page xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/change-dev-prod-mode.adoc[].

[template-version]
=== Template version

In this section, you can select the template version for your registry.

[NOTE]
====
The *Template version* field is required.
====

*Template version* points to a specific component branch in the Gerrit repository that contains the corresponding version of the registry template. You can choose between the latest current version or the previous stable version:

* *The latest version* — contains the latest approved changes and new functionality. For example, `1.9.9.50`. It is recommended to select the current version to use all current settings.
* *Previous stable version* — recommended to select only in case of a justified need. For example, `1.9.8.23`.

//TODO: ASK OLESYA
[WARNING]
====
*Preparing for migration*

Before migrating your registry to a new version that doesn't use multiple templates, there are some preparations you need to make.

*Working with the `values.yaml` file*

`values.yaml` is a configuration file that contains all the settings for your registry. You need to manually populate this file with the necessary values that match the template you chose when you created the registry, or other appropriate settings.

*Committing changes*

After making changes to `values.yaml`, it is important to commit these changes to Gerrit.

*Migrating registry*

Only after you have completed the above steps, the registry is ready to migrate to the new version.

This process ensures that all your registry settings and configurations will be correctly migrated during the upgrade and that the new version will work according to your needs and requirements.
====

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

[#create-registry-admins]
== Creating registry administrators

In this step, you can assign registry administrators.

[NOTE]
====
You can also add administrators by editing the registry soon after its deployment.

For details, see xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/create-users/create-registry-admins.adoc[].
====

. In the *Administrators* field, specify the administrators who will have access to the registry.
+
CAUTION: This field is required.
It means *at least ONE admin* must be added here.
+

.. Click the *+* (*Add*) button and provide the following details for each registry administrator:
+
--
* *First name*
* *Last name*
* *Email address*
* *Temporary password*
--
+
[CAUTION,caption=Password requirements]
====
* At least 10 characters in length.
* At least one lowercase letter.
* At least one uppercase letter.
* At least one digit.
* At least one special character (@, #, $, %, ^, &, +, =).
* Use Latin characters only.
* No spaces.
====
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-2.png[]

+
.. To add several administrators, repeat this step for each user separately: menu:click *+*[provide details > Confirm].
+
[NOTE]
====
Use a lower case for email addresses.

Allowed characters are: digits (`0-9`), Latin letters (`a-z`), underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), at sign (`@`), dots (`.`), and commas (`,`).
====

. When ready, click *Next* to proceed.
+
image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-2-1.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The system automatically creates a registry administrator account in the `openshift` realm of the *Keycloak* service.
This account is assigned the `cp-registry-admin-<registry-name>` role and placed in the `/cp-registry-admin-<registry-name>` group,
where `<registry-name>` is the name of your registry.
====

[#mail-server]
== Mail server settings

In this step, you can configure which mail server your registry will use to send email notifications.

[NOTE]
====
This step is optional.
You can skip it during the registry creation and configure it later when editing the registry.
====

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-4.png[]

The Platform offers two mail server configuration options:

* *Platform mail server* (`platform-mail-server`)
A built-in mail server provided as part of the Platform, available to all registries within the same Platform instance.

* *External mail server* (`external-mail-server`)
An external mail provider (for example, *Gmail*) that you configure separately.

[TIP]
====
For detailed configuration instructions, see
xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/user-notifications/email/config-smtp-server.adoc[Configuring the SMTP server].
====

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

====
The default instance type is `r5.2xlarge`.
====

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-6-03.png[]

=== Use AWS EC2 Spot instance (optional)

The *Use AWS EC2 Spot instance* setting is optional and disabled by default.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-6-04.png[]

If you enable it, additional settings appear:

* **Max price of an AWS EC2 instance (per hour)**:
Define the maximum hourly price you’re willing to pay for EC2 Spot Instances.

Spot Instances offer significant cost savings compared to On-Demand Instances
but come with reduced availability guarantees,
as AWS can terminate them if demand increases.

You can choose:

* *On-Demand instance price* (default): Pay the standard (higher) price for guaranteed availability.
* *Specify your own price ($/hour)*: Set a custom maximum price. If the current market price stays below your limit, the instance runs. If the price rises above it, AWS may automatically terminate the instance.

image:admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-6-05.png[]

=== System disk type of AWS EC2 instance

The *System disk type of AWS EC2 instance* field is required.

Options include:

[NOTE]
====
The default setting is **ON**.
====

=== User self-registration

*Allow self-registration* — toggle whether to enable user self-registration for officers.
This option simplifies the registration process by letting users register themselves through a pre-modeled self-registration business process, without administrator involvement.

[NOTE]
====
The default setting is **OFF**.

If disabled, users who have started the self-registration process will not be able to complete their tasks if they are modeled.
====

[TIP]
====
For more details, see
xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/cp-auth-setup/cp-officer-self-registration.adoc[].
====

=== Authentication type

====

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

[#geoserver]
== Geodata management subsystem

In this step, you can enable the *Geodata management subsystem*,
an essential component for registries that handle spatial data.
This subsystem provides tools for storing, processing, visualizing, and distributing geospatial information.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-11-02.png[]

You can adjust the following option:

* *Deploy the geodata management subsystem* — activate integration with geoinformation services, geospatial databases, and tools for creating and administering geodata.

[CAUTION]
====
This option is *disabled by default*.

Once the registry is created, you *cannot* change this setting later.
Carefully consider whether you need the Geodata management subsystem at this stage,
especially if your registry relies on geospatial data for analytics, planning, or visualization.
====

➡️ To learn more about geoserver capabilities, see
xref:registry-develop:registry-admin/geoserver.adoc[].

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

== Artifacts storage

In this step, you can choose where to store the generated artifacts produced by your registry.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-11-03.png[]

You can adjust the following option:

* The *Storage type* parameter decides whether to store registry artifacts within the Platform’s shared storage or in a dedicated registry storage.

Options:

* **Platform** (recommended) — store artifacts in the Platform’s shared storage, which helps conserve registry resources and ensures efficient performance.
* **Registry** — store artifacts in separate registry-specific storage if you prefer independent management and resource separation.

[NOTE]
====
The default is *Platform*.
====

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

== Digital documents

In this step, you can manage the upload restrictions for digital documents handled by users and business processes.
Specifically, you can configure:

* *Max file size for upload, MB* — defines the *File Maximum Size* parameter in the *File* component in the UI form modeler.
* *Max total upload size for file group, MB* — defines the *Maximum total size* parameter in the *File* component in the UI form modeler.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-11-04.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* Values are entered in megabytes (MB) and can include digits (`0–9`) and a decimal point (`.`).
* The value can be up to 4 characters long (for example, `10`, `100`, `50.2`).
* The maximum allowed value cannot exceed the **100 MB** upload request limit set at the Platform level.
* The maximum size for a single file cannot be greater than the maximum total size allowed for the group.

Administrative restrictions apply at the system level, but additional limits can also be set per individual file fields when modeling UI forms.
====

➡️ For more details on configuring digital document upload settings, see xref:admin:registry-management/control-plane-digital-documents.adoc[].

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

== Backup settings

In this step,
you can configure the backup schedule for your registry components
and define how long backup copies are retained in the backup repository.

Backups are created using the *Velero* tool and stored securely in *MinIO* backup storage outside the Platform cluster.
The backup schedule is defined using the https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[unix-cron] format directly in the Control Plane interface.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-11.png[]

Additionally, the system automatically replicates data stored in *OBC Ceph buckets*,
and you can configure a replication schedule for these as well.

[NOTE]
====
Backup configuration is **disabled by default**.
====

When enabled, you can:

* Set the retention period for backup copies.
* Define the schedule for Ceph OBC replications.
* Specify the backup storage location for Ceph OBC replications.
* Enter custom values for advanced control.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-11-1.png[]

[TIP]
====
* To learn how to configure *automatic backups* and OBC bucket replications, see xref:admin:backup-restore/backup-schedule-registry-components.adoc[].
* To learn how to create **manual backups** and restore the registry environment, see xref:admin:backup-restore/control-plane-backup-restore.adoc[].
====

When ready, click *Next* to proceed.

== Confirmation and deployment

To complete the setup process, click the *Create a registry* button.

You can return to any of the settings tabs to review and double-check the data you entered before finalizing.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-10.png[]

Once initiated, the registry will appear in the *Registries* section of the *Control Plane* interface.

If the deployment is successful, a green check mark will appear next to the registry name in the *Status* column.

image::admin:registry-management/registry-create/cp-create-registry-12-1-en.png[]

The deployment process takes some time.
The *Jenkins* service automatically starts the deployment by running a pipeline called
*Master-Build-`<registry-name>`*,
where `<registry-name>` is the name you assigned to your registry.

To monitor the deployment:

. Go to the *Registries* section.
. Open the registry you just created.
. Scroll down to the *Configuration* section.
. Click the *Jenkins* link icon in the *CI* column.
