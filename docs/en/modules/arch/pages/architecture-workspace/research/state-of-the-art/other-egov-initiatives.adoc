= Global approaches to building e-government platforms
include::platform:ROOT:partial$templates/document-attributes/arch-set-en.adoc[]

== Introduction

Governments around the world are rethinking how public services are delivered. To make them more accessible, efficient, and scalable, many are turning to modern e-governance platforms.

This short overview highlights three notable government tech initiatives from different countries:

* *Digit-Core* — a modular platform developed in the EU to accelerate the creation of interoperable digital services.
* *Singapore Government Tech Stack* — a comprehensive suite of tools and APIs for fast, secure service development.
* *eGovernment Standard Framework (eGSF)* — South Korea’s architecture for standardizing and streamlining public service delivery.

Each platform takes a unique approach to designing, building, and operating digital government services.

By reviewing their structures and principles, we can better understand which global practices might be adapted or considered for developing the *Registries Platform*.

== Digit-Core

*_Digit-Core_* is a *modular, open-source platform* designed to simplify the development and deployment of digital public services. It was created specifically for government agencies and public-sector organizations. The platform is maintained and promoted by the *Indian non-profit eGov Foundation* and is released under https://github.com/egovernments/DIGIT-OSS/blob/master/LICENSE[MIT license].

Originally, Digit-Core was built to speed up the creation of municipal services. It provides reusable building blocks for applications such as:

* property tax payments
* utility billing
* service connection requests
* urban planning approvals
* complaints and grievance tracking
* and others

Today, the platform’s scope has expanded, but its *core focus* remains—*enabling streamlined, end-to-end digital service delivery for citizens*.

The typical user journey follows this pattern:

.Typical usage pattern
image::architecture-workspace/research/state-of-the-art/digit-flow.png[width=640,float="center",align="center"]

* A citizen registers or logs in, submits a service request with the required documents, makes a payment, and tracks the request status.
* A government official (officer) reviews the request, updates the status, adds comments, and closes it once the service is delivered or rejected.
* The citizen can raise a support issue or provide feedback when needed.
* Technical administrators monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.
* Leadership teams get access to analytics for planning, budgeting, and continuous service improvement.

Digit-Core follows a *microservices architecture* designed to run in *Kubernetes-based* environments. It provides a set of APIs, backend services, and reference implementations.

.Digit-Core microservices architecture
image::architecture-workspace/research/state-of-the-art/digit.png[width=640,float="center",align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
The platform core *doesn't include* certain infrastructure components such as an API gateway, message queue, relational database, or analytics database (shown in gray). *Instead, it requires the hosting environment to provide*:

* Netflix Zuul as an API gateway
* Apache Kafka for messaging
* PostgreSQL for relational data
* Elasticsearch for analytics
====

Developers use *Java* and *Spring Boot* to build services, and *ReactJS* or *Flutter* to create cross-platform frontend apps for Android and iOS.

To simplify the development process, Digit includes:

* A code generation utility that scaffolds new services based on API specifications and declarative workflow definitions.
* A reusable component library for building consistent, user-friendly interfaces across modules—for UI development.

Beyond technology, Digit also *promotes a governance model* for implementing digital public services using the Digit-Core platform.

.Governance structure

== Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)

The *_Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)_* is a national initiative to develop and promote a shared technology infrastructure for public-sector agencies in Singapore.

At the foundation of this initiative is the https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud/overview.html[Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)] — a *"wrapper" platform* that provides agencies with a unified way to access commercial cloud services from approved providers.

.GCC high-level framework
image::architecture-workspace/research/state-of-the-art/gcc-fig1.png[]

GCC offers centralized tools for onboarding, billing, monitoring, and compliance with government standards when using cloud infrastructure.

As of now, the GCC supports Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, with Google Cloud planned in the 2023 roadmap.

Built on top of GCC, the https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/[Singapore Government Tech Stack] provides a set of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) components hosted within GCC. These services are available to government agencies for free or on a subscription basis. SGTS also includes guidelines and standards for building digital government services based on best practices.

In other words, when developing or launching digital services, agencies can rely on the shared infrastructure provided by GCC and reuse the cloud-hosted components available through SGTS.

=== Core features and capabilities

SGTS comprises two layers:

* *Base layer*—standardizes tools for development and environment management
* *Service layer*—enables reuse of shared capabilities across agencies

.SG Tech Stack layers

* Location-based services
* Multimedia controls
* Mobile device identification

A full list of available components is published on the official websites:
https://www.egovframe.go.kr/wiki_en/doku.php?id=v3.5:runtime_framework_common3.5[eGSF Common Components]
https://www.egovframe.go.kr/eng/sub.do?menuNo=17[eGSF Mobile Common Components]

=== Key advantages

* Fully open-source and licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.
* Public documentation, training materials, and support available from the development team.
* Support for mobile application development.

=== Limitations and challenges

* Requires a high level of IT expertise, including knowledge of legacy technologies that are rarely used today.
* Relies on outdated tools that offer limited flexibility, user experience, and scalability compared to modern alternatives.
* Based on a monolithic, non–cloud-native architecture typical of mid-2000s software.
* Does not address data storage, secure persistence, or data lineage—making it less suitable for modern registry-based systems.

== Comparison

Each of the reviewed platforms overlaps with the functionality of the *Registries Platform* to some extent, but none of them offers feature parity across the board. While they cover different aspects—such as infrastructure, workflows, or service templates—none provides a comprehensive solution that matches the full scope of the Registries Platform.

Beyond the shared capabilities, the Registries Platform delivers several unique advantages not found in any of the systems discussed:

* The platform includes a fully configured set of dependencies out of the box, including container orchestration, traffic routing, databases, monitoring, and backup tools. This eliminates the need for separate setup and maintenance of infrastructure components, ensuring security and reliability standards while reducing the burden on technical administrators.

* Unlike all the compared platforms, the Registries Platform is built as a *low-code* solution. It allows developers to focus on business logic, prototype faster, and maintain or extend systems with less manual coding. This approach accelerates development cycles and lowers the barrier for teams working on digital public services.

* The platform includes a secure data persistence and access layer that complies with data immutability and provenance requirements. This is a critical capability for building trustworthy, audit-ready government registries.

== Conclusion

The following areas stand out as opportunities for further development within the Registries Platform. These features are either missing or not yet fully addressed:

* Integrated billing and payment processing.
* Mobile-friendly citizen interfaces.
* Internationalization and multilingual support.
* A well-documented implementation methodology, especially around collaboration with public-sector stakeholders and government-as-a-client delivery models.
